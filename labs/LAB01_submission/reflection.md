# Reflection: OOP Design Decisions

Write 2-3 paragraphs reflecting on your object-oriented design. Some questions to consider:

- Why did you structure your classes the way you did?
- What inheritance relationships did you use and why?
- What was challenging about managing multiple interacting objects?
- If you had more time, what would you refactor or add?
- How does this experience connect to working with OOP in analytics/ML codebases?
