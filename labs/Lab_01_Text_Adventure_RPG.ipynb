    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll build your very own text-based adventure RPG using the object-oriented programming skills you learned in Lecture 4. Text adventures were *huge* in the 1980s—games like *Zork* and *Colossal Cave Adventure* captured imaginations before fancy graphics existed. Now it's your turn to create one!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Goal**: Build a working text-based adventure game with:\n",
    "- A character system (player and enemies)\n",
    "- Multiple connected locations to explore\n",
    "- A dice-based combat system\n",
    "- A win condition (defeat a boss, retrieve an artifact, escape, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Budget**:\n",
    "- In-class Session 1: ~1 hour 15 minutes (Planning + Core Classes)\n",
    "- In-class Session 2: ~1 hour 15 minutes (Combat + Game Loop)\n",
    "- Out-of-class: >=1 hour 15 minutes (Polish + Creativity + README)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: The point of this lab isn't just to make a game—it's to get comfortable managing interconnected OOP code, which is *exactly* what you'll encounter on real ML/analytics teams. Build iteratively, test often, and have fun!\n",

    "### 🛠️ A Note About the Starter Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provided throughout this lab is meant to **guide** you, not **constrain** you. Think of it as scaffolding—a suggested structure to get you started. You should feel completely free to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modify** any code we provide to fit your vision\n",
    "- **Add** new methods, attributes, or entire classes\n",
    "- **Reorganize** things if a different structure makes more sense for your game\n",
    "- **Ignore** suggestions that don't work for your theme\n",
    "\n",
    "This is YOUR game. If you want your combat system to work differently, your locations to have different attributes, or your classes organized another way—go for it! The requirements are about *what* your game should do (have characters, locations, combat, etc.), not *how* you implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note about Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a checklist of deliverables at the end of this notebook. You can do your work in this notebook as it guides you along, but ultimately you will copy your code to `labs/LAB01_submission/`. In this folder, you will submit:\n",
    "1. GAME CODE: `game.py` (and other .py files if you prefer) containing your classes and game logic\n",
    "2. DESIGN DOCUMENT: `design.md` file in your submission folder where you write/update your game design notes as you work through the lab\n",
    "3. README: `readme.md` file in your submission folder, explaining how to play your game\n",
    "4. REFLECTION: `reflection.md` file in your submission folder, discussing your OOP design decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer, the starter code from this notebook is already copied into `game.py` and stubs for the markdown documents. You can choose to edit files directly in the submission folder as you work through the lab. Just make sure to work iteratively, test early, test often, following the testing suggestions in this notebook. Keep your design notes and README/reflection in the appropriate markdown files in the submission folder. Or work here and copy files over at the end—whatever workflow you prefer!"

    "1. **Build iteratively**: Get the simplest version working first, then add features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test constantly**: After each change, run your code to catch bugs early.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use print statements**: When debugging, add `print()` statements to see what's happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Keep methods small**: Each method should do ONE thing. If it's getting long, break it up.\n",
    "\n",
