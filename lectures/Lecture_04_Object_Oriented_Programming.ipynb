    "## Why Classes? Inspired by Struct\n",
    "\n",
    "A long time ago in a galaxy far far away... programmers realized they needed something more than just regular variables. They wanted a way to group together a bunch of variables that were naturally related.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wanted to represent a point in 3D space. We would need to keep track of the three coordinates for the point, the x,y and z coordinates. We could just define them as three variables in our code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "x = 2.0\n",
    "y = 3.5\n",
    "z = 1.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that nowhere in the code is the idea that these three variables are related to the same point. And what if we wanted to represent a whole bunch of points?  Should we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "x1 = 2.0\n",
    "y1 = 3.5\n",
    "z1 = 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "x2 = 0.5\n",
    "y2 = 1.78\n",
    "z2 = -2.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts to get very messy. This is where the idea of a Struct came in.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Struct (short for structure) is a way of structuring a bunch of related variables together. They don't formally exist in Python, because classes can do what structs can do and a whole lot more. So I'll show you what a struct looks like in the C programming language:\n",

    "```C\n",
    "struct Point {\n",
    "  float x;\n",
    "  float y;\n",
    "  float z;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The struct is a definition of a point variable, which holds the three coordinate variables x, y, z \"inside of it\". If we wanted to make a new point in our C program, we would do it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "struct Point somePoint;\n",
    "somePoint.x = 2.0;\n",
    "somePoint.y = 3.5;\n",
    "somePonit.z = 1.3;\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first line above declares that the variable somePoint is a struct and that the template defined earlier tells us its structure. The next three lines set the values of the x,y,z variables that live \"inside of\" somePoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of structs really helped programmers out with organizing their code better and grouping related variables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we had some function that was designed specifically to be used on points. Where should we put that function? \n",

It would be nice if we could just make both changes at the same time using a function:\n",

    "Such a function could set `relationshipStatus=\"married\"` and also change the person's name to the \"Holly McClane\" (the argument we passed into the function). Because the function only operates on the variables that \"live inside of\" the person, it should really also \"live inside\" the person. Structs can't accomodate that, but classes can. And, as we will see, classes can do a lot of other really useful things.\n"
