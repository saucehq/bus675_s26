    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we covered four essential Python best practices and modern patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "## F-Strings\n",
    "- Clean, readable string formatting with `f\"...{expression}...\"`\n",
    "- Format specifiers for numbers, percentages, and dates\n",
    "- Debugging with the `=` specifier\n",
    "\n",
    "## List and Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
    "- Concise list creation: `[expr for item in iterable if condition]`\n",
    "- Dictionary comprehensions: `{key: value for item in iterable}`\n",
    "- Using `zip()` to combine iterables\n",
    "- Real-world file operations with `pathlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lambda Functions\n",
    "- Anonymous one-liners: `lambda args: expression`\n",
    "- Best used as arguments to `sorted()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `.apply()`\n",
    "- When to use named functions instead\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Hints\n",
    "- Annotating variables and functions with types\n",
    "- Common types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `list[T]`, `dict[K, V]`, `Optional[T]`\n",
    "- Benefits: IDE support, documentation, bug prevention\n",
    "- Not enforced at runtime—just helpful documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns will make your code more readable, maintainable, and robust. You'll see them everywhere in modern Python libraries and production code—like the unwritten rules that everyone in the field just knows."
